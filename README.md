## documentation

- [guides](docs/index.md)
- [go docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jonhadfield/gosn-v2)

## basic usage

The following example shows how to use this library to interact with the SN API directly. To prevent a full download of all items on every sync, use the provided [cache package](cache/README.md) to persist an encrypted copy to disk, only syncing deltas on subsequent calls.

## installation

```bash
GO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/jonhadfield/gosn-v2
```

## importing

```go
import "github.com/jonhadfield/gosn-v2"
```

## basic usage

### authenticating

Sign-in to obtain your session

```go
sio, _ := gosn.SignIn(gosn.SignInInput{
    Email:    "user@example.com",
    Password: "topsecret",
})
```

### initial sync

An initial sync is required to retrieve your items, as well as your Items Keys that are then added to your session

```go
so, _ := gosn.Sync(gosn.SyncInput{
    Session: &sio.Session,
})
```

### decrypt and parse items

```go
items, _ := so.Items.DecryptAndParse(&sio.Session)
```

## running tests

Execute the full test suite using the standard Go tooling:

```bash
go test ./...
```

This runs all unit tests across the repository.
